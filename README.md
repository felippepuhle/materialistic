# Materialistic

Why you shouldn't use crappy frameworks:

- You'll have a cleaner code
- You won't waste time to customize the crappy framework
- You won't do 'gambiarras' to reach the desired UI/UX
- You won't be vulnerable by update bugs
- Better scalability

*Crappy frameworks are supposed to help on basic stuff, and not to create a whole complex web system*
